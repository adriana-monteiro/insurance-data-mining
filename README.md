# Segmentation of Customers for A2Z Insurance - A Data Mining Project

This project, developed as a part of the Data Mining course of the Master's in Data Science and Advanced Analytics at NOVA IMS, aims to segment customers of a (fictional) insurance company using unsupervised learning techniques. The goal was to devise new general marketing approaches tailored to each cluster of clients.



## Key Project Components:
1. Data Exploration:
   * Analysing each feature and relationships between features (graphics, correlations, ...);
   * Indetifying inconsistencies within the data, missing values and outliers;
2. Data preprocessing:
   * Encoding categorical variables;
   * Imputing missing data;
   * Resolving previously identified issues;
   * Feature engineering and selection.
3. Customer Segmentation via different clustering models and perspectives:
   * K-Means;
   * K-Prototypes;
   * Hierarchical Clustering;
   * Self-Organizing Maps (SOM);
   * DBSCAN.
4. Possible business strategies based on the results on cluster analysis.
